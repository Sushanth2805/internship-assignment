# ðŸ§ª Backend Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Create .env File

Make sure your `backend/.env` file has all required variables:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Start Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000 in development mode
âœ… MongoDB Connected: cluster0-xxxxx.mongodb.net
```

### 4. Test Basic Endpoint

Open browser or use curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "message": "Book Review Platform API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "active"
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MongoDB connection error"

**Solution:** Check your `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` file. Make sure:

- Username and password are correct
- IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Database name is specified

### Issue: "Not authorized to access this route"

**Solution:** Make sure you're sending the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Issue: "User already exists"

**Solution:** Use a different email or login with existing credentials

### Issue: "Not authorized to update/delete this book"

**Solution:** You can only edit/delete books you created. Login with the account that created the book.

### Issue: "You have already reviewed this book"

**Solution:** Each user can only review a book once. Update or delete your existing review instead.

### Issue: "Image upload failed"

**Solution:** Check your Cloudinary credentials in `.env` file:

- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
